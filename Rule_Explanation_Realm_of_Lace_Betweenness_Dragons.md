## Overview

This is a network-based cellular automaton where **nodes represent cells** and **edges represent connections between neighbors**. Unlike traditional CA where cells are simply "on" or "off", this rule treats the grid as a **dynamic graph** where both nodes and edges can form, break, and evolve based on network topology metrics.

The rule operates in **three distinct phases** per simulation step:

1. **Eligibility Phase** - Calculate which nodes are eligible to participate in the network
2. **Edge Formation Phase** - Connect nodes based on mutual eligibility
3. **Final State Phase** - Determine final node states based on resulting network topology

---

## Phase 1: Eligibility Determination

### Core Concept
Each node calculates an "eligibility metric" based on its neighbors' **previous state** (their degree/connectivity from the last step). This determines whether the node can form connections in this step.

### For The Amazing Dragons Rule: BETWEENNESS Metric

**Birth Eligibility** (inactive nodes trying to become active):
- **Metric Type:** BETWEENNESS (proxy)
- **Aggregation:** SUM (add up values from all neighbors)
- **Calculation:** For each neighbor, compute `1.0 / neighbor_degree` if degree > 0, else 0
  - High betweenness = low connectivity (nodes with fewer connections have higher betweenness proxy)
  - Example: A neighbor with degree 2 contributes 1.0/2 = 0.5 to the sum
- **Range Check:** Birth occurs if the sum falls in `[(1.4, 7.0)]`
- **Interpretation:** A node can be "born" if its neighbors have **intermediate to high betweenness** (meaning they're moderately connected, not too isolated or too saturated)

**Survival Eligibility** (active nodes trying to stay active):
- **Metric Type:** BETWEENNESS (proxy)
- **Aggregation:** SUM
- **Calculation:** Same as birth (sum of 1/degree for each neighbor)
- **Range Check:** Survival occurs if the sum falls in `[(0.9, 2.6)]`
- **Interpretation:** A node survives if its neighbors have **low to moderate betweenness** (they're more connected than the birth threshold requires)

### What This Means
- **Birth favors nodes surrounded by moderately connected neighbors** (betweenness sum 1.4-7.0)
- **Survival favors nodes surrounded by well-connected neighbors** (betweenness sum 0.9-2.6, lower values = higher connectivity)
- This creates a dynamic where new growth happens near moderately connected regions, but stable structures need higher connectivity

## Phase 2: Edge Formation

### Mutual Eligibility Rule
After calculating eligibility for all nodes, edges are formed based on **mutual eligibility**:

```
An edge exists between nodes A and B if:
  - A is eligible (eligibility_proxy > 0.5), AND
  - B is eligible (eligibility_proxy > 0.5), AND
  - They are spatial neighbors (Moore neighborhood, 8 surrounding cells)
```

### Characteristics
- **Symmetric:** If A connects to B, then B connects to A
- **Binary:** Edges either exist (state = 1.0) or don't (state = 0.0)
- **Spatial Constraint:** Only adjacent cells (Moore neighborhood) can form edges
- **Grid Boundary:** "wrap" mode means edges can form across grid boundaries (toroidal topology)

### Important Note
Edge formation happens **after** eligibility is determined but **before** final state calculation. This means:
- Eligibility uses **previous step's** degrees
- Final state uses **current step's** degrees (after new edges form)

## Phase 3: Final State Determination

### Node State Representation
In Realm of Lace, **node state = node degree** (number of edges connected to the node).

After edges form, each node's final state is determined by:

1. **Calculate the final degree:** Count edges connected to this node after Phase 2
2. **Apply the Final Check Metric:** DEGREE (using the degree itself)
3. **Check Life/Death Conditions:**

**Final Life Conditions** (explicit survival):
- **Values:** `[2, 4, 8]`
- If degree equals 2, 4, or 8 exactly → Node **survives** with state = degree

**Final Death Conditions** (explicit death):
- **Values:** `[1, 7]`
- If degree equals 1 or 7 exactly → Node **dies** (state = 0)

**Default Behavior** (implicit survival):
- If degree doesn't match any life or death condition → Node **survives** with state = degree
- This means degrees like 0, 3, 5, 6 also survive (unless they were explicitly killed earlier)

### Logic Priority
1. **Life conditions override everything** (if degree is 2, 4, or 8 → guaranteed survival)
2. **Death conditions apply next** (if degree is 1 or 7 → guaranteed death)
3. **Default is survival** (any other degree survives)

## Step-by-Step Example

Let's trace a node through one complete step:

### Initial State (Step N-1)
- Node A: degree = 3 (state = 3.0)
- Its neighbors have degrees: [2, 4, 1, 0, 5, 3, 2, 4]

### Step N - Phase 1: Eligibility

**Calculate neighbor betweenness sum:**
```
Sum = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/1 + 0 + 1/5 + 1/3 + 1/2 + 1/4
    = 0.5 + 0.25 + 1.0 + 0 + 0.2 + 0.33 + 0.5 + 0.25
    = 3.03
```

**Check survival eligibility:**
- Node A is active (degree = 3 > 0)
- Survival range is [(0.9, 2.6)]
- 3.03 is NOT in range
- **Result:** Node A is **INELIGIBLE** (eligibility_proxy = 0.0)

### Step N - Phase 2: Edge Formation
- Node A is ineligible
- **No edges can form** from Node A's perspective
- Any existing edges to A are removed (since edges require mutual eligibility)

### Step N - Phase 3: Final State
- Node A's new degree = 0 (no edges)
- Final check metric = DEGREE = 0
- Death condition check: 0 ≠ 1 and 0 ≠ 7 (not in death list)
- Life condition check: 0 ≠ 2, 0 ≠ 4, 0 ≠ 8 (not in life list)
- **Default survival applies**
- **Final state = 0** (survives but with degree 0)

## Network Dynamics

### Emergent Behaviors

**Growth Mechanism:**
- New nodes appear near moderately connected regions (betweenness sum 1.4-7.0)
- This favors expansion at the "edges" of structures where connectivity is intermediate

**Stability Mechanism:**
- Active nodes survive when surrounded by well-connected neighbors (betweenness sum 0.9-2.6)
- Highly connected cores tend to be stable

**Fragility Points:**
- Nodes with degree 1 or 7 die immediately (even if eligible)
- This creates "pruning" of very sparse (degree 1) or very dense (degree 7) connections

**Stable Configurations:**
- Degrees 2, 4, 8 are explicitly protected (forced survival)
- These are likely sweet spots for the rule's intended dynamics

### The "Dragons" Effect
The name "Amazing_Dragons_Wow" refers to the emergent patterns this specific parameter set creates:
- The betweenness-based eligibility creates branching, fractal-like growth with long "dragon" patterns
- The degree constraints (death at 1 and 7, life at 2, 4, 8) create structured, dragon-like shapes
- The difference between birth (1.4-7.0) and survival (0.9-2.6) ranges creates expanding "heads" with stable "bodies"

## Visualization

**Node Colors:**
- Colored by degree (0-26 range, using "prism" colormap)
- Low degree = cooler colors
- High degree = warmer colors
- This makes connectivity patterns immediately visible

**Edge Colors:**
- Colored by "ActiveNeighbors" mode
- Shows the connectivity context of each edge
- Uses "prism" colormap (0-16 range)

---

## Key Differences from Traditional CA

1. **Explicit Network Structure:** Edges are first-class entities, not implicit
2. **Two-Phase State:** Eligibility (based on past) → Edges (present) → State (consequence)
3. **State = Topology:** Node state directly represents its connectivity (degree)
4. **Metric-Based Rules:** Uses graph theory metrics (betweenness proxy) instead of simple neighbor counts
5. **Mutual Eligibility:** Both nodes must "agree" to form an edge (symmetric requirement)

---

## Technical Parameters Verified

From code inspection of `RealmOfLaceUnified._compute_final_state()`:

✅ **Eligibility calculation:** Uses SUM of neighbor betweenness (1/degree)  
✅ **Range checking:** Correctly applies `[(0.9, 2.6)]` for survival, `[(1.4, 7.0)]` for birth  
✅ **Edge formation:** Uses mutual eligibility check (both nodes > 0.5)  
✅ **Final state:** Node state = final degree after edge updates  
✅ **Death conditions:** Degree 1 or 7 → state = 0  
✅ **Life conditions:** Degree 2, 4, or 8 → state = degree (forced survival)  
✅ **Default:** Any other degree survives with state = degree

## Conclusion

This rule creates a **sophisticated network dynamics system** where:
- Growth is governed by the topology of the surrounding network (betweenness)
- Edges form through mutual agreement (bilateral eligibility)
- Final survival depends on the resulting connectivity (degree)
- Specific degree values (1, 2, 4, 7, 8) have special significance

The interplay between betweenness-based eligibility and degree-based survival creates rich, evolving network structures that likely produce dragon-like patterns - hence the evocative name.
